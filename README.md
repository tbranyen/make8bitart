# make8bitart

[make8bitart.com](http://make8bitart.com) is a web-based pixel art application that's super fun and easy to use!

## installation

Just download the source and direct your browser to the `index.html` of the project root directory. It's just HTML, JavaScript and CSS, so no need for a special server setup.

## dependencies

make8bitart.com uses jQuery and two jQuery plugins I wrote: [draggybits](https://github.com/jennschiffer/draggybits) and [pixelDiv](https://github.com/jennschiffer/pixelDiv)

## misc notes

8-bit truthers will complain that the color palette is not actually 8-bit. I discuss this on my ["blog"](http://negativitysandwiches.com/making-an-8-bit-color-picker/). If that makes you really angry, then I suggest you take a nap, butthorn.

This is an agile development cycle, so I'm poppin' in features as I come up with them or as folks request them. Expect changes here often, and do not be shocked to find gross code. If you have suggestions, I'm totally open to hear them and learn if you're not a nerf dart about it!

I designed, built, and created all of the graphics for this passion project. The dinosaur art in the source was found through a variety of geocities websites. 

If you have feature requests, let me know via Twitter (see below). I am currently *not* accepting pull requests. If that makes you really angry, then I suggest you take a nap, butthorn.
